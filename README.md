# MLNS_LinkPrediction
This repo serves as part of the Machine Learning in Network Science course assignment, with a goal of predicting missing links in an actor co-occurence network. Edges have been deleted at random from a graph. Your mission is to accurately reconstruct the initial network using both graph-theoretical and node feature information.
